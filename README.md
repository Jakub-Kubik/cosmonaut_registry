# Cosmonaut Registry

## Introduction

This project serves as a cosmonaut data management system, primarily focusing on creating (C) and reading (R) operations as part of CRUD. The 'Create' operation is managed through a producer-consumer pattern using RabbitMQ, while the 'Read' operation is exposed through a RESTful API built with FastAPI.

## Features

- Dockerized components for easy setup and deployment
- RESTful API for fetching cosmonaut data
- Producer-Consumer pattern using RabbitMQ for asynchronous data storing
- Backend database using PostgreSQL

## Installation and Setup

### Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose

### Local Development

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/cosmonaut_registry.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd cosmonaut_registry
    ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

    Update all environment variables and credentials in `.env` file.

4. **Build and Start Docker Containers:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    > Note: It's advisable to first run RabbitMQ to populate the database with data and then start the FastAPI application.

5. **Access FastAPI Application:**

    Your FastAPI application should now be running at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### Running the RabbitMQ Producer and Consumer

After setting up your environment, run the RabbitMQ producer and consumer:

```bash
docker-compose up rabbitmq_producer rabbitmq_consumer
```

## Usage

You can perform CRUD operations through the API:

- **Read Individual Cosmonaut**: `GET /cosmonaut/{cosmonaut_id}`
- **List All Cosmonauts**: `GET /cosmonauts?skip=0&limit=10`

To view the full API documentation, which is auto-generated by FastAPI, visit [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs).
